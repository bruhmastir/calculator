# integer-calculator-console
Basic Quad-function integer-only calculator in C++ that is still limited to CLI interface

What it basically does is that it dispays a list of functions that it can perform and then asks the user to input the number of operation found in the menu/list, before asking for operand1 then operand2. Lastly it does the calculation and prints the answer. It also asks the user if he needs to use the calculator again before terminating the program. It can perform only 4 basic functions: 
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Division 
4. Multiplication
